# Overview
This is a 2D simulation of the Apollo 11 Lunar Moduleslanding on the moon, it uses a basic homemade physics engine to simulate a safe landing.

# Development Environment
This program was written in Visual Studio using the C++ language , the standard namespace and the openGL library.


# Future Work
* Debug physics sometimes making the lander go backward 
* better implement thrust at an angle to be more prominent
* implement a second Lunar Module to allow multiplayer
* Variable gravity values for increased/decreased diffculty, perhaps having the values come from other planets in our solar system
